  <h1>Bournemouth Chinese Christian Fellowship</h1>
  Demonstrating God's love together in Bournemouth. We do this by celebrating the new life He has given us as we believe and follow Jesus Christ.
  
  <h2>Bournemouth Cantonese Christian Fellowship</h2>
  Please join our 10:30am Sunday service at <a href="http://www.bicuk.org">Bournemouth International Church</a>. The Sermon will be translated to Cantonese and the worship songs will be in either Mandarin or Cantonese with Chinese lyrics displayed on the large screens. We are registered with <a href="https://ukhk.org/">UKHK</a> and welcome new arrivals from Hong Kong. We would love to have you join us at BIC but if this is not possbile for you, you can find other churches on the <a href="https://ukhk.org/">UKHK website</a>.
  <h2>Mandarin Chinese House Church - Equipping saints to reach mainland China</h2>
  We are not a building, we are a body of believers with Jesus the head. The Church in China does not have to be a building either, the Church thrives as a large and growing number of house churches of fewer members each. If you are looking to visit China and want to learn some basic Mandarin Chinese or worship in Mandarin, this group is for you. We also have Chinese people in the group, some to help us learn Mandarin, others come to learn English. We are currently running a Mandarin Christian Worship evening on most Saturday's. Please visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/121895267933594/" target="_blank">Bournemouth Mandarin Chinese Christian Fellowship</a> where you can find more information.
  <h3>Prayer Request</h3>
  Even if you are unable to join us in person, we'd still love you to pray for us.
  <ul>
    <li>Particularly that we effectively equip Chinese students to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ back to China.</li>
    <li>That we are supported by more native Chinese speaking Christian leaders.</li>
    <li>We are guided by the Holy Spirit to grow this fellowship in a God honouring way.</li>
    <li>New house churches all over China.</li>
    <li>Above all, that the name of Jesus is glorified.</li>
